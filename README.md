#Disable Scroll
A jQuery plugin to contextually disable/reenable page scrolling when an element is hovered over. This
plugin is useful when you have an element, such as an iframe, which wants to intercept events like
the scrollwheel without scrolling the page it's embedded in.

## Usage
```js
$('#target').disableScroll(); // that's all there is!
```
